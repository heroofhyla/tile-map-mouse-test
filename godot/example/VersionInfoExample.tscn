licenses to display them in-game. It demonstrates use of the DirAllTextDisplay
and FileTextDisplay classes.

Note that these classes inherit from Label, not RichTextLabel, for the sake of
simplicity. If you need the extra features of RichTextLabel, you can edit
DirAllTextDisplay.gd and FileTextDisplay.gd to inherit from RichTextLabel
instead. You would probably also want to set the bbcode_text property instead
of the text property.

In my own projects, the change log and the licenses wouldn't actually go on the
same page; the change log and version info would go on a settings page, while
the licenses would go in the credits."
